            <p>
                Guess you dreams always end.<br>
                They don't rise up, just descend,<br>
                But I don't care anymore,<br>
                I've lost the will to want more,<br>
                I'm not afraid not at all,<br>
                I watch them all as they fall,<br>
                But I remember when we were young.<br>
                <br>
                Those with habits of waste,<br>
                Their sense of style and good taste,<br>
                Of making sure you were right,<br>
                Hey don't you know you were right?<br>
                I'm not afraid anymore,<br>
                I keep my eyes on the door,<br>
                But I remember.<br>
                <br>
                Tears of sadness for you,<br>
                More upheaval for you,<br>
                Reflects a moment in time,<br>
                A special moment in time,<br>
                Yeah we wasted our time,<br>
                We didn't really have time,<br>
                But we remember when we were young.<br>
                <br>
                And all God's angels beware,<br>
                And all you judges beware,<br>
                Sons of chance, take good care,<br>
                For all the people not there,<br>
                I'm not afraid anymore,<br>
                I'm not afraid anymore,<br>
                I'm not afraid anymore,<br>
                Oh, I'm not afraid anymore.<br>
