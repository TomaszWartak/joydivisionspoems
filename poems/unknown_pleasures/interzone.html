            <p>
                I walked through the city limits,</br>
                Someone talked me in to do it,</br>
                Attracted by some force within it,</br>
                Had to close my eyes to get close to it,</br>
                Around a corner where a prophet lay,</br>
                Saw the place where she'd had a room to stay,</br>
                A wire fence where the children played</br>
                Saw the bed where the body lay,</br>
                And I was looking for some friends of mine.</br>
                And I had no time to waste.</br>
                Yeah, looking for some friends of mine.</br>
                </br>
                The cars screeched hear the sound on dust,</br>
                Heard a noise just a car outside,</br>
                Metallic blue turned red with rust,</br>
                Pulled in close by the building's side,</br>
                In a group all forgotten youth,</br>
                Had to think, collect my senses now,</br>
                Are turned on to a knife edged view</br>
                Find some places where my friends don't know,</br>
                And I was looking for a friend of mine,</br>
                And had no time to waste.</br>
                Yeah, looking for some friends of mine.</br>
                </br>
                Down the dark streets, the houses looked the same,</br>
                Getting darker now, faces look the same,</br>
                And I walked round and round.</br>
                No stomach, torn apart,</br>
                Nail me to a train.</br>
                Had to think again,</br>
                trying to find a clue, trying to find a way to get out!</br>
                Trying to move away, had to move away and keep out.
