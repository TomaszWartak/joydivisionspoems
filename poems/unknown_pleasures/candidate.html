            <p>
                Forced by the pressure,<br/>
                The territories marked,<br/>
                No longer the pleasure,<br/>
                Oh, I've since lost the heart.<br/>
                <br/>
                Corrupted from memory,<br/>
                No longer the power,<br/>
                It's creeping up slowly,<br/>
                The last fatal hour.<br/>
                <br/>
                Oh, I don't what made me,<br/>
                What gave me the right,<br/>
                To mess with your values,<br/>
                And change wrong to right.<br/>
                <br/>
                Please keep your distance,<br/>
                The trail leads to here,<br/>
                There's blood on your fingers,<br/>
                Brought on by fear.<br/>
                <br/>
                I campaigned for nothing,<br/>
                I worked hard for this,<br/>
                I tried to get to you,<br/>
                You treat me like this.<br/>
                <br/>
                It's just second nature,<br/>
                It's what we've been shown,<br/>
                We're living by your rules,<br/>
                That's all that we know.<br/>
                <br/>
                I tried to get to you,<br/>
                I tried to get to you,<br/>
                I tried to get to you.<br/>
                I tried to get to you.<br/>
