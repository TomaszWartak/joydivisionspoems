            <p>
                Guess you dreams always end.<br/>
                They don't rise up, just descend,<br/>
                But I don't care anymore,<br/>
                I've lost the will to want more,<br/>
                I'm not afraid not at all,<br/>
                I watch them all as they fall,<br/>
                But I remember when we were young.<br/>
                <br/>
                Those with habits of waste,<br/>
                Their sense of style and good taste,<br/>
                Of making sure you were right,<br/>
                Hey don't you know you were right?<br/>
                I'm not afraid anymore,<br/>
                I keep my eyes on the door,<br/>
                But I remember.<br/>
                <br/>
                Tears of sadness for you,<br/>
                More upheaval for you,<br/>
                Reflects a moment in time,<br/>
                A special moment in time,<br/>
                Yeah we wasted our time,<br/>
                We didn't really have time,<br/>
                But we remember when we were young.<br/>
                <br/>
                And all God's angels beware,<br/>
                And all you judges beware,<br/>
                Sons of chance, take good care,<br/>
                For all the people not there,<br/>
                I'm not afraid anymore,<br/>
                I'm not afraid anymore,<br/>
                I'm not afraid anymore,<br/>
                Oh, I'm not afraid anymore.<br/>
