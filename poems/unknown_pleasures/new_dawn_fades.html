            <p>
                A change of speed, a change of style<br/>
                A change of scene, with no regrets<br/>
                A chance to watch, admire the distance<br/>
                Still occupied, though you forget<br/>
                <br/>
                Different colors, different shades<br/>
                Over each mistakes were made<br/>
                I took the blame<br/>
                <br/>
                Directionless so plain to see<br/>
                A loaded gun won't set you free<br/>
                So you say<br/>

                We'll share a drink and step outside<br/>
                An angry voice and one who cried<br/>
                'We'll give you everything and more<br/>
                The strain is too much, can't take much more<br/>
                <br/>
                Oh, I've walked on water, run through fire<br/>
                Can't seem to feel it anymore<br/>
                It was me, waiting for me<br/>
                <br/>
                Hoping for something more<br/>
                Me, seeing me this time<br/>
                Hoping for something else<br/>
            </p>
