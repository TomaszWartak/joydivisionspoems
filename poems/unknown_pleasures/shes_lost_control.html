            <p>
                Confusion in her eyes that says it all.<br/>
                She's lost control.<br/>
                And she's clinging to the nearest passer by,<br/>
                She's lost control.<br/>
                <br/>
                And she gave away the secrets of her past,<br/>
                And said I've lost control again,<br/>
                And a voice that told her when and where to act,<br/>
                She said I've lost control again.<br/>
                <br/>
                And she turned around and took me by the hand and said,<br/>
                I've lost control again.<br/>
                And how I'll never know just why or understand,<br/>
                She said I've lost control again.<br/>
                <br/>
                And she screamed out kicking on her side and said,<br/>
                I've lost control again.<br/>
                And seized up on the floor, I thought she'd die.<br/>
                She said I've lost control.<br/>
                <br/>
                She's lost control again.<br/>
                She's lost control.<br/>
                She's lost control again.<br/>
                She's lost control.<br/>
                <br/>
                Well I had to 'phone her friend to state my case,<br/>
                And say she's lost control again.<br/>
                And she showed up all the errors and mistakes,<br/>
                And said I've lost control again.<br/>
                <br/>
                But she expressed herself in many different ways,<br/>
                Until she lost control again.<br/>
                And walked upon the edge of no escape,<br/>
                And laughed I've lost control.<br/>
                <br/>
                She's lost control again.<br/>
                She's lost control.<br/>
                She's lost control again.<br/>
                She's lost control.<br/>
