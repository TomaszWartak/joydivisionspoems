            <p>
                To the center of the city where all roads meet, waiting for you,<br/>
                To the depths of the ocean where all hopes sank, searching for you,<br/>
                I was moving through the silence without motion, waiting for you,<br/>
                In a room with a window in the corner I found truth.<br/>
                <br/>
                In the shadowplay, acting out your own death, knowing no more,<br/>
                As the assassins all grouped in four lines, dancing on the floor,<br/>
                And with cold steel, odor on their bodies mad a move to connect,<br/>
                But I could only stare in disbelief as the crowds all left.<br/>
                <br/>
                I did everything, everything I wanted to,<br/>
                I let them use you for their own ends,<br/>
                To the center of the city in the night, waiting for you.<br/>
                To the center of the city in the night, waiting for you.<br/>
            </p>
