            <p>
                I've been waiting for a guide to come and take me by the hand,<br/>
                Could these sensations make me feel the pleasures of a normal man?<br/>
                These sensations barely interest me for another day,<br/>
                I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, take the shock away.<br/>
                <br/>
                It's getting faster, moving faster now, it's getting out of hand,<br/>
                On the tenth floor, down the back stairs, it's a no man's land,<br/>
                Lights are flashing, cars are crashing, getting frequent now,<br/>
                I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, let it out somehow.<br/>
                <br/>
                What means to you, what means to me, and we will meet again,<br/>
                I'm watching you, I'm watching her, I'll take no pity from you friends,<br/>
                Who is right, who can tell, and who gives a damn right now,<br/>
                Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know,<br/>
                Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know,<br/>
                Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know,<br/>
                I've got the spirit, but lose the feeling,<br/>
                I've got the spirit, but lose the feeling,<br/>
                Feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling.<br/>
            </p>
