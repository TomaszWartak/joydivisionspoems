            <p>
                I traveled far and wide through many different times,<br/>
                What did you see there?<br/>
                I saw the saints with their toys,<br/>
                What did you see there?<br/>
                I saw all knowledge destroyed.<br/>
                I traveled far and wide through many different times.<br/>
                <br/>
                I traveled far and wide through prisons of the cross,<br/>
                What did you see there?<br/>
                The power and glory of sin,<br/>
                What did you see there?<br/>
                The blood of Christ on their skins,<br/>
                I traveled far and wide through many different times.<br/>
                <br/>
                I traveled far and wide and unknown martyrs died,<br/>
                What did you see there?<br/>
                I saw the one sided trials,<br/>
                What did you see there?<br/>
                I saw the tears as they cried,<br/>
                They had tears in their eyes,<br/>
                <br/>
                Tears in their eyes,<br/>
                Tears in their eyes,<br/>
                Tears in their eye.
