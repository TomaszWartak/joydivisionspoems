                <p>
                    This is the room, the start of it all,<br/>
                    No portrait so fine, only sheets on the wall,<br/>
                    I've seen the nights, filled with bloodsport and pain,<br/>
                    And the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Where will it end? Where will it end?<br/>
                    Where will it end? Where will it end?<br/>
                    <br/>
                    These are your friends from childhood, through youth,<br/>
                    Who goaded you on, demanded more proof,<br/>
                    Withdrawal pain is hard, it can do you right in,<br/>
                    So distorted and thin, distorted and thin.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Where will it end? Where will it end?<br/>
                    Where will it end? Where will it end?<br/>
                    <br/>
                    This is the car at the edge of the road,<br/>
                    There's nothing disturbed, all the windows are closed,<br/>
                    I guess you were right, when we talked in the heat,<br/>
                    There's no room for the weak, no room for the weak,<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Where will it end? Where will it end?<br/>
                    Where will it end? Where will it end?<br/>
                    <br/>
                    This is the room, the start of it all,<br/>
                    Through childhood, thorugh youth, I remember it all,<br/>
                    Oh, I've seen the nights filled with bloodsport and pain.<br/>
                    And the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Where will it end? Where will it end?<br/>
                    Where will it end? Where will it end?
                </p>
