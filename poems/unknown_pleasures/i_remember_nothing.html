            <p>
                We were strangers.</br>
                We were strangers, for way too long, for way too long,</br>
                We were strangers, for way too long.</br>
                Violent, violent,</br>
                Were strangers.</br>
                </br>
                Get weak all the time, may just pass the time,</br>
                Me in my own world, yeah you there beside,</br>
                The gaps are enormous, we stare from each side,</br>
                We were strangers for way too long.</br>
                </br>
                Violent, more violent, his hand cracks the chair,</br>
                Moves on reaction, then slumps in despair,</br>
                Trapped in a cage and surrendered too soon,</br>
                Me in my own world, the one that you knew,</br>
                For way too long.</br>
                We were strangers, for way too long.</br>
                We were strangers,</br>
                We were strangers, for way too long.</br>
                For way too long.
