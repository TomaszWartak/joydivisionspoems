            <p>
                A legacy so far removed,</br>
                One day will be improved.</br>
                Eternal rights we left behind,</br>
                We were the better kind.</br>
                </br>
                Two the same, set free too,</br>
                I always looked to you,</br>
                I always looked to you,</br>
                I always looked to you.</br>
                </br>
                We fought for good, stood side by side,</br>
                Our friendship never died.</br>
                On stranger waves, the lows and highs,</br>
                Our vision touched the sky,</br>
                </br>
                Immortalists with points to prove,</br>
                I put my trust in you.</br>
                I put my trust in you.</br>
                I put my trust in you.</br>
                </br>
                A house somewhere on foreign soil,</br>
                Where ageless lovers call,</br>
                Is this your goal, your final needs,</br>
                Where dogs and vultures eat,</br>
                Committed still I turn to go.</br>
                </br>
                I put my trust in you.</br>
                I put my trust in you.</br>
                I put my trust in you.</br>
                I put my trust in you.</br>
                In you. In you. In you.</br>
                Put my trust in you, in you.
