            <p>
                Procession moves on, the shouting is over,</br>
                Praise to the glory of loved ones now gone.</br>
                Talking aloud as they sit round their tables,</br>
                Scattering flowers washed down by the rain.</br>
                </br>
                Stood by the gate at the foot of the garden,</br>
                Watching them pass like clouds in the sky,</br>
                Try to cry out in the heat of the moment,</br>
                Possessed by a fury that burns from inside.</br>
                </br>
                Cry like a child, though these years make me older,</br>
                With children my time is so wastefully spent,</br>
                A burden to keep, though their inner communion,</br>
                Accept like a curse an unlucky deal.</br>
                </br>
                Played by the gate at the foot of the garden,</br>
                My view stretches out from the fence to the wall,</br>
                No words could explain, no actions determine,</br>
                Just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall.
            </p>
