                This is a crisis I knew had to come,</br>
                Destroying the balance I'd kept.</br>
                Doubting, unsettling and turning around,</br>
                Wondering what will come next.</br>
                </br>
                Is this the role that you wanted to live?</br>
                I was foolish to ask for so much.</br>
                Without the protection and infancy's guard,</br>
                It all falls apart at first touch.</br>
                </br>
                Watching the reel as it comes to a close,</br>
                Brutally taking it's time,</br>
                People who change for no reason at all,</br>
                It's happening all of the time.</br>
                </br>
                Can I go on with this train of events?</br>
                Disturbing and purging my mind,</br>
                Back out of my duties, when all's said and done,</br>
                I know that I'll lose every time.</br>
                </br>
                Moving along in our God given ways,</br>
                Safety is sat by the fire,</br>
                Sanctuary from these feverish smiles,</br>
                Left with a mark on the door,</br>
                </br>
                Is this the gift that I wanted to give?</br>
                Forgive and forget's what they teach,</br>
                Or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more,</br>
                And watch as they drop by the beach.</br>

                This is the crisis I knew had to come,</br>
                Destroying the balance I'd kept,</br>
                Turning around to the next set of lives,</br>
                Wondering what will come next.
