            <p>
                Here are the young men, the weight on their shoulders,</br>
                Here are the young men, well where have they been?</br>
                We knocked on the doors of Hell's darker chamber,</br>
                Pushed to the limit, we dragged ourselves in,</br>
                </br>
                Watched from the wings as the scenes were replaying,</br>
                We saw ourselves now as we never had seen.</br>
                Portrayal of the trauma and degeneration,</br>
                The sorrows we suffered and never were free.</br>
                </br>
                Where have they been?</br>
                Where have they been?</br>
                Where have they been?</br>
                Where have they been?</br>
                </br>
                Weary inside, now our heart's lost forever,</br>
                Can't replace the fear, or the thrill of the chase,</br>
                Each ritual showed up the door for our wanderings,</br>
                Open then shut, then slammed in our face.</br>
                </br>
                Where have they been?</br>
                Where have they been?</br>
                Where have they been?</br>
                Where have they been?
            </p>
