            <p>
                So this is permanent, love's shattered pride.,</br>
                What once was innocence, turned on its side.</br>
                A cloud hangs over me, marks every move,</br>
                Deep in the memory, of what once was love.</br>
                </br>
                Oh how I realized how I wanted time,</br>
                Put into perspective, tried so hard to find,</br>
                Just for one moment, thought I'd found my way.</br>
                Destiny unfolded, I watched it slip away.</br>
                </br>
                Excessive flash points, beyond all reach,</br>
                Solitary demands for all I'd like to keep.</br>
                Let's take a ride out, see what we can find,</br>
                A valueless collection of hopes and past desires.</br>
                </br>
                I never realized the lengths I'd have to go,</br>
                All the darkest corners of a sense I didn't know.</br>
                Just for one moment, I heard somebody call,</br>
                Looked beyond the day in hand, there's nothing there at all.</br>
                </br>
                Now that I've realized how it's all gone wrong,</br>
                Gottas find some therapy, this treatment takes too long.</br>
                Deep in the heart of where sympathy held sway,</br>
                Gotta find my destiny, before it gets too late.
            </p>
