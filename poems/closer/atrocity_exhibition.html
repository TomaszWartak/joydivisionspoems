            <p>
                Asylums with doors open wide,<br/>
                Where people had paid to see inside,<br/>
                For entertainment they watch his body twist<br/>
                Behind his eyes he says, 'I still exist.'<br/>
                <br/>
                This is the way, step inside.<br/>
                This is the way, step inside.<br/>
                This is the way, step inside.<br/>
                This is the way, step inside.<br/>
                <br/>
                In arenas he kills for a prize,<br/>
                Wins a minute to add to his life.<br/>
                But the sickness is drowned by cries for more,<br/>
                Pray to God, make it quick, watch him fall.<br/>
                <br/>
                This is the way, step inside.<br/>
                This is the way, step inside.<br/>
                This is the way, step inside.<br/>
                This is the way, step inside.<br/>
                <br/>
                This is the way.<br/>
                This is the way.<br/>
                This is the way.<br/>
                This is the way.<br/>
                This is the way, step inside.<br/>
                This is the way, step inside.<br/>
                This is the way, step inside.<br/>
                This is the way, step inside.<br/>
                <br/>
                You'll see the horrors of a faraway place,<br/>
                Meet the architects of law face to face.<br/>
                See mass murder on a scale you've never seen,<br/>
                And all the ones who try hard to succeed.<br/>
                <br/>
                This is the way, step inside.<br/>
                This is the way, step inside.<br/>
                This is the way, step inside.<br/>
                This is the way, step inside.<br/>
                <br/>
                And I picked on the whims of a thousand or more,<br/>
                Still pursuing the path that's been buried for years,<br/>
                All the dead wood from jungles and cities on fire,<br/>
                Can't replace or relate, can't release or repair,<br/>
                Take my hand and I'll show you what was and will be.
