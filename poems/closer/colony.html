            <p>
                A cry for help, a hint of anesthesia,</br>
                The sound from broken homes,</br>
                We used to always meet here.</br>
                As he lays asleep, she takes him in her arms,</br>
                Some things I have to do, but I don't mean you harm.</br>
                </br>
                A worried parent's glance, a kiss, a last goodbye,</br>
                Hands him the bag she packed, the tears she tries to hide,</br>
                A cruel wind that blows down to our lunacy</br>
                And leaves him standing cold here in this colony.</br>
                </br>
                I can't see why all these confrontations,</br>
                I can't see why all these dislocations,</br>
                No family life, this makes me feel uneasy,</br>
                Stood alone here in this colony.</br>
                In this colony, in this colony, in this colony, in this colony.</br>
                </br>
                Dear God in his wisdom took you by the hand,</br>
                God in his wisdom made you understand.</br>
                God in his wisdom took you by the hand,</br>
                God in his wisdom made you understand.</br>
                </br>
                God in his wisdom took you by the hand,</br>
                God in his wisdom made you understand.</br>
                God in his wisdom took you by the hand,</br>
                God in his wisdom made you understand.</br>
                In this colony, in this colony, in this colony, in this colony.
